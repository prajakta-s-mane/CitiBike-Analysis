# CitiBike-Analysis

Used JSON to obtain data from the NYC CitiBike project. The CitiBike project provides an application
programming interface (API) that members of the public can access to get up-todate
information on the status of more than 800 bike stations. Installed the RCurl and jsonlite packages.

Generated a histogram of the number of docks available

Generated a histogram of the number of bikes available

Explored stations with at least one ebike by create a new dataframe, that only has
stations with at least one eBike.

Created a new attribute, called ‘stationSize’, which is the total number of “slots”
available for a bike (that might, or might not, have a bike in it now). Ran a
histogram on this variable and review the distribution.
